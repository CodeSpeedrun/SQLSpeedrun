WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	=> Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%'	=> Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%'	=> Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	=> Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"

--The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that does NOT start with "a":
